Management of rabbitmq:

To install the Docker:
1. Download the installer from https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
2. Before installation, open a PowerShell console as Administrator and run the following command (Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v):
```
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```
3. Install the Docker with the Installer. 
Tip: I installed a WSL on my computer which failed the Docker after the installation. So during the installation, I unchecked the WSL relative stuff before finishing the Dock installation.
