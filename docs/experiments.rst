Software
======================

We used the low_level_driver for controlling the system, and to activate the actuators and record data we used the code in 
`/software/digital_twin/experiments/`.


Temperature Uniformity
======================

Two experiments where made.

The first one is detailed here:

The second one (with a more powerfull fan) is detailed here:

Calibration
===========

Two models are currently calibrated.

Details are in the following figure:
