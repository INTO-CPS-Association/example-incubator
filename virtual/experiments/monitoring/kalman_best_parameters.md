# Kalman Best Parameters
This is an experiment that compares the plant model output to the Kalman Filter Model Output.
 
The input is based on the best parameters for G_box, C_air, C_heater and G_heater.



The output consists of three graphs:
1. The average temperature by the plant model vs the temperature by the Kalman Filter Model.
1. The actuation of the heater. 1 is on, 0 is off.
1. The temperature of the heater by the plant model vs the temperature of the heater by the Kalman Filter Model.
